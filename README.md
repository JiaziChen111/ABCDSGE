This directory holds the files for replicating the procedure used
to get results for the DSGE model in the paper "Indirect Likelihood
Inference" by Michael Creel and Dennis Kristensen

The estimator is an Approximate Bayesian Computing estimator,
computed using importance sampling and local linear nonparametric
regression. 

Requires Open MPI, Julia (with MPI and Distances packages), Octave (with MPI
package) and other supporting code available at

http://pareto.uab.es/mcreel/Econometrics/Econometrics.tgz

or

http://pareto.uab.es/mcreel/Econometrics/Econometrics.zip

To replicate the results, execute MasterScript from the bash prompt.
